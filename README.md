<h1 align="center"> MCOMPARISON OF THE PERFORMANCE NAIVE BAYES AND KNN METHODS ON THE INDONESIAN TOURISM DESTINATION RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM</h1>

## Description

The use of information technology in various activities has become the routine of daily life, not least in the tourism sector. Based on this, tourism requires strategies and decisions in the development of facilities and infrastructure that can support the development and progress of tourism by utilizing information technology. One of the uses of information technology is to create a dashboard as a data visualization tool. Dashboards have advantages in terms of ease and speed of processing data into visual information. For users from non-Information Technology backgrounds, the dashboard is a
solution to be reckoned with

### About the dataset:

The dataset we use is the Indonesia Tourism Destination Dataset which we take from the kaggle site which can be accessed via the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aprabowo/indonesia-tourism-destination . The dataset consists of 13 Features and 437 Tourism Object data.
